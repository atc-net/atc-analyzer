# Package Icon

Please place a 128x128 PNG file named `icon.png` in this directory.

This icon will be displayed in NuGet.org and in Visual Studio when the analyzer package is installed.

## Requirements
- Format: PNG
- Size: 128x128 pixels (recommended)
- Transparent background preferred
- Should represent the ATC.NET organization or analyzer functionality

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can:
1. Use the ATC.NET organization logo if available
2. Create a simple icon with text "ATC" or analyzer symbol
3. Download a free icon from sites like flaticon.com or icons8.com

The build will fail without this file, so please add it before building the NuGet package.
